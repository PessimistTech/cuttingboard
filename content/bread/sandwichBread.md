# Sandwich Bread
*Yield: 1 loaf*

## Ingredients:

- 1 C warm water
- 2 Tb sugar
- 2 t yeast
- 1/4 C vegetable oil
- 2.5 â€“ 3.5 C flour
- 1 t salt

## Instructions:

1. In the bowl of your stand mixer or bread machine, add the water,
sugar and yeast and let sit for 10 minutes. 
2. Add the rest of the ingredients and mix until a nice ball forms. The dough should feel
elastic, but not dry. Add more flour if dough is sticky.
3. Let dough rise in a warm place until double, about 1.5 hours. 
4. Shape into a smooth log and place in a greased bread pan. 
5. Let rise again, about 20 minutes. I usually let it go until it looks the right size for a
loaf of bread. 
6. Bake at 350 for about 30-35 minutes, until bread is dark golden and sounds hollow when tapped.
