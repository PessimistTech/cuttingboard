# French Bread
*Yields: 2 loaves | Cook Time: 30min | Prep Time: 2hr 30min*

## Ingredients:

- 2 1/4 C warm water
- 2 Tbsp sugar
- 1 Tbsp instant/active dry yeast
- 3/4 - 1 Tbsp salt
- 2 Tbsp olive oil (or any other oil)
- 5 1/2 - 6 C all-purpose or bread flour

## Instructions:

1. In the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine the water sugar and yeast. Let sit for 3-5 min, until foamy. (No need to let sit if using instant yeast)
2. Add salt, oil, 3 cups of flour and mix. Add the rest of the flour gradually until the dough clears the sides of the bowl and forms a soft ball 
(should not leave lots of residue on your finger when poked). Knead for 2-3 min until the dough is smooth. (add small amounts of flour as needed).
3. Leave the dough in the mixer, cover with lid or towel and let the dough rest for 10 min, then sir it down by turning on the mixer for about 10 seconds. Repeat 5 more times. 
(If desired you can use a slightly greased bowl, cover and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour, instead)
4. Turn the dough onto a lightly greased surface and divide in half. Pat each section into a thick rectangle (approx 9x13in) and roll up from the long side. Press out any air bubbles
or seams as you go. Pinch the edge to seal. Place seam side down on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Score the top of each loaf several times.
5. Cover and let rest until puffy and nearly doubled in size (about 1 hour).
6. Place oven rack in center position and preheat oven to 375F.
7. Place baking sheet in oven and toss 3-4 ice cuves onto the bottom of the oven to help give the bread a crust. Close the oven door quickly.
8. Bake for 25-30 min until golden brown and baked thoroughly. Brush with butter and salt if desired.
9. Repeat for second loaf if you used separate baking sheets.
