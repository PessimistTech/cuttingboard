- 1 large egg PLUS one yolk (room temperature)
- 5 to 7 cups bread flour or all purpose
- Oil for coating bowl

- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter room temperature
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1 tablespoon all purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- pinch of salt
- 2 cups fresh raspberries (more needed for topping)
- 1 tablespoon cream for each roll room temperature

#### Frosting:

- 6 oz cream cheese, softened regular (not low or no fat)
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 2 1/2 - 3 cups powdered sugar
- pinch of salt

#### Topping

## Instructions

#### Dough:

1. Combine water and dry milk powder in a large bowl of a stand mixer. You may also use a
whisk and mix this portion by hand.
2. Add yeast, 1/4 cup sugar, 2 teaspoons salt, ⅓ cup melted butter, 1/4 cup oil, 1 egg
PLUS 1 yolk, and 2 cups of the bread flour. Mix on low speed until ingredients are
combined. Increase mixer speed to medium and mix for about 1 minute. Turn mixer off.
3. Add 2 more cups of flour. Mix on low speed until ingredients are combined for 2 minutes
at low speed. Dough will start to get stiff. Remaining flour may need to be mixed in by
hand.
4. Add remaining flour, ½ cup at a time, until dough is soft and not sticky or wet looking.
When the flour is mixed in, scrape down sides of bowl, and turn dough over in bowl.
Lightly apply oil to the inside of the bowl with cooking spray or a paper towel coated
with canola oil or butter.
5. Set the bowl in a warm place away from drafts. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a
light clean kitchen towel and let rise for about 60-90 minutes or until dough has doubled.

#### Filling:
(prepare while dough is rising)
1. Wash raspberries gently in cold water, toss lightly and drain so all of the water is out of
the cavity of the fruit. Let sit on on paper towel and come to room temperature while
dough is being prepared and rising. Save about 1 1/2 cups of the raspberries for topping
the rolls after baked and cooled. Two cups of the raspberries go in the filling of the roll.
2. In a small bowl, mix 1/2 cup granulated sugar, 1 tablespoon all purpose flour, cinnamon
and salt. Set aside.

#### Frosting:

(prepare while rolls are baking)
1. Place 6 oz cream cheese and 3 tablespoons unsalted butter in a large mixing bowl or
bowl of a stand mixer. Mix until combined.
2. Add 3 cups powdered sugar, vanilla and salt. Mix on low until powdered sugar is
combined. If mixture is too thick, add a little milk or cream. Set aside until ready to frost
rolls.

#### Assembly:

1. When the dough has risen, generously flour a clean surface with all purpose flour.
2. Roll out dough into approximately a 20"x10" rectangle. Spread 6 tablespoons room
temperature butter over filling. Sprinkle filling onto the dough evenly. Sprinkle 2 cups of the
raspberries on top of the filling evenly over the dough
Roll up the dough, starting with the long side, until the dough is rolled into one long piece.
3. Using unflavored dental floss or thread, cut the rolled dough into 12 evenly sized rolls.
4. Butter a 9x13 pan (or line with parchment paper). Place the rolls into prepared pans.
5. Cover the rolls with parchment or a clean kitchen towel. Let rise for about 45 minutes in a
draft free place at least 72 degrees.
6. Place rack in middle of oven, and preheat oven to 375 degrees 15 minutes before baking.
7. Before baking, pour 1 tablespoon cream or half and half over each roll in pan. Make sure
the cream is room temperature.
8. Bake the rolls for 18-20 minutes or until golden on top and the bottom is cooked and
slightly golden as well. While rolls are baking, make frosting.
9. Remove from oven and let cool for about 5 minutes. While rolls are still hot, frost with about
1/2 of the frosting, being careful to not press down on the rolls too much.
10. After 30 minutes, frost rolls with remaining cream cheese frosting and place a few fresh
raspberries on top of each roll before serving.

#### Recipe Notes:
{{% notice note %}}
If you do not have access to dry milk, you may use 2 cups of whole milk, warmed just a
bit. I like the texture better when using dry milk and water.

For make ahead: Follow directions, make dough, let rise, roll up dough and cut into
pieces. Instead of letting rise again in pan, place the rolls in a freezer proof pan, cover
tightly and freeze. When ready to bake, remove from freezer and place in a warm (at least
72 degrees) room, covered. Let rise for about 3 hours. or until almost doubled in size. Top
with cream and bake as directed.
