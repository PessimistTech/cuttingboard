# Smores Cookie Bars
*Yield: 16 bars*

## Ingredients:

- 1/2 cup butter (room temperature) 
- 1/4 cup brown sugar
- 1/2 cup sugar 
- 1 large egg
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 1/3 cups all purpose flour
- 3/4 cup graham cracker crumbs
- 1 tsp baking powder 
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 2 king-sized milk chocolate bars (e.g. Hershey's)
- 1 1/2 cups marshmallow creme/fluff (not melted marshmallows)

## Instructions:

1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F. 
2. Grease an 8-inch square baking pan.
3. In a large bowl, cream together butter and sugar until light. 
4. Beat in egg and vanilla. 
5. In a small bowl, whisk together flour, graham cracker crumbs, baking powder and salt. Add to butter mixture and mix at a low speed until combined.
6. Divide dough in half and press half of dough into an even layer on the bottom of the prepared pan.
7. Place chocolate bars over dough. (2 king-sized Hershey's bars should fit perfectly side by side, but break the chocolate if necessary to get it to fit in a single laver no more than 1/4 inch thick. 
8. Spread marshmallow creme or fluff over the chocolate, and place remaining dough in a single laver on top of the fluff (most easily achieved by flattening the dough into small shingles and laying them together).
9. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until lightly browned. 
10. Cool completely before cutting into bars.
