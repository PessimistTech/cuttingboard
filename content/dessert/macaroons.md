# Macaroons

## Ingredients:

- 4 egg whites room temperature
- 1/3 cup white sugar
- 2 1/2 cups Powdered sugar
- 1 1/2 cups almond flour
- Pinch salt
- 1/2 tsp cream of tartar
- 1-2 drops gel food coloring (color of choice)

## Instructions:

1. Preheat oven to 300F degrees. Make sure your oven is on the conventional setting. (or in
other words, if your oven has a fan inside of it, avoid having the fan on).
2. Sift the almond flour and powdered sugar into a bowl and mix to combine. (Sifting is
important for consistency).
3. Beat the egg whites on high speed until foamy, then add the salt and cream of tartar. Mix
for another minute then add the sugar. Beat for another 4-5 minutes or until stiff peaks
form. (Beat in color and any desired flavor at this step)
4. Fold flour/sugar mixture into the egg white mixture. Be careful NOT to over mix. About 80
turns of your spatula should be enough. You want the batter to resemble the consistency
of molten lava.
5. Line cookie sheets with parchment paper. Fill a pastry bag with the batter. Using a circle
piping tip about 1/2 inch in diameter, pipe out 1 inch mounds.
6. Take the cookie sheets and bang them onto the counter a few times to get rid of any air. I
hit them pretty hard, about 10 times.
7. Let the macarons sit in room temperature for about 30-50 minutes. It really depends on
how quickly they become tacky to the touch. If you live in an area with a lot of humidity, it
may take longer for the macarons to form the "skin".
8. Bake 1 tray at a time for 17-18 minutes.
9. Fill each sandwich with desired filling.
