# Hoagie Rolls
*Yields: 4 Hoagies | Cook Time: 20 min | Prep Time: 2hr 40min*

## Ingredients:

#### Dough:
- Milk 260g
- Yeast 6g
- Flour 400g (bread or all purpose)
- Honey 10g
- Olvie Oil 20g
- Salt 8g

#### Baking:
- Cornmeal a sprinkle
- Egg whites from 1 egg
- Water a splash
- ice cubes 4-6

## Instructions:

1. Mix the dough. Heat the milk to between 105-110°F/40-43°C to optimize yeast activity. Add the yeast to the warm milk and stir to combine. Let stand for 3-5 minutes until light foam surfaces and bubbles are visible. Meanwhile, add the flour, honey, olive oil, and salt to a large mixing bowl. Once the yeast is proofed, pour in the mixture and vigorously mix the dough until no dry flour remains in the bowl and a cohesive mass forms, about 2 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 15 minutes.
1. Once rested, knead for 8-10 minutes. The dough should be completely smooth and no longer sticky. After kneading the dough, cut off a piece and test for gluten development by carefully stretching the dough very thin to check for a see-through 'window' before tearing.
1. Once done kneading, place the dough in a bowl and cover. Let rise until doubled in size, about 45-60 minutes.
1. Once doubled in size, punch the dough down and divide it into 4 equal portions, roughly 175 grams each. Using your fingertips lightly press and stretch and piece of dough into a rectangle about 8 inches wide and 1 inch thick. Then, tightly roll the dough from the bottom to the top. Press and seal the seam created on the bottom of the roll. Now, you should have a log of dough with the seam side down. Applying even pressure with the palm of your hands in the center of the dough begin gently rolling the log out into a cylinder, about 10 inches long.
1. Cover baking sheet(s) lightly in cornmeal or line with parchment paper. Shape each hoagie roll and place on baking sheet(s). Cover lightly with plastic wrap or a towel and let the rolls proof until about 1.5 to 2 times in size, another 45-60 minutes.
1. With 15 minutes of proofing left, preheat the oven to 375°F/190°C. Place an oven-safe pan or another baking sheet on the bottom rack of the oven. (In the next step, ice will be dropped on the hot pan to help create a environment for a better oven spring.)
1. Using a razor or sharp knife, score the hoagie rolls with one long slash at a 45-degree angle to allow for oven spring.
1.  Whisk the egg white and spoonful of water together. Using a brush, lightly spread the egg wash on the exterior to give us a better crust. Sprinkle a little extra cornmeal over top (if desired). Place the rolls into the oven on the middle rack and toss in 4 to 5 ice cubes on the preheated pan which will create a steamy environment for better oven spring.
1. Bake for 10 minutes then rotate the pan. Continue baking for another 8-10 minutes until the crust is golden brown and the internal temperature reaches 200°F/93°C (use a thermometer).
1. Let cool completely on a wire rack.
