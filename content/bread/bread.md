# Bread 
*Yield: 4 loaves | Cook Time: 25 min | Total Time: 3 hr 30 min*

## Ingredients:
- 3 Tbsp yeast
- 1 Tbsp sugar
- 1 C water
- 10 C flour
- 1/2 C sugar
- 1 Tbsp salt
- 1/2 C vegetable oil
- 3 C warm water

## Instructions:
1. In a small bowl, mix yeast with 1 Tbsp sugar and 1 cup warm water. Stir until dissolved. Let sit
until doubled (about 10 min).
2. In a large mixing bowl add 9 1/2 cups flour, 1/2 cup sugar, and salt.
3. In the center of the flour, pour the yeast mixture and add oil and 3 cups warm water. Mix together
with wooden spoon (it will look shaggy). Clear dough off the sides of the bowl and let rest for 15
min.
4. Knead dough until the texture is consistent and smooth throughout (a few min).
5. Cover dough with light cloth and let rise until doubled in size. Punch down the dough and let it
rise for another hour (second rise makes lighter loaves, but can be skipped if desired).
6. Punch down dough and cut into 4 equal sections. Shape each dough section into a loaf and place
in greased loaf pans. Butter the tops and cover with a cloth. Let rise about 45 min, or until
doubled and about an inch above the tin.
7. Bake 375Â°F for 25 min, or until golden brown.
