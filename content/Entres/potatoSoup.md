# Creamy Potato Soup 

## Ingredients:

- 1 (30 oz.) bag frozen hash-brown potatoes (I used cubed)
- 2 (14 oz.) cans chicken broth (see Note)
- 1 (10.75 oz.) can cream of chicken soup
- ½ cup chopped onion
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper (more to taste)
- 1 (8oz) package cream cheese (softened)
- Optional Toppings: cheese, bacon, sliced green onions

## Instructions:

1. In a slow cooker, combine potatoes, chicken broth, soup, onion, and pepper.
2. Cover and cook on low for 5-6 hours. If your potatoes are still in big chunks you need to cook it
longer. They will start falling apart when it's ready.
3. Add the cream cheese and cook 30 minutes or until cream cheese is melted, stirring occasionally,
until combined.
4. Top with cheese, bacon, or sliced green onions if desired.

The soup is thick and creamy. Feel free to add more broth or milk to thin it to your desired consistency
