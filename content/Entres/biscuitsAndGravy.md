2. Whisk together dry ingredients. 
3. Cut in the shortening until it is in pea sized pieces. Whisk together the wet ingredients, and add to the dry ingredients. 
4. Knead and fold the dough about 8 times to develop the layers. (Don’t over work the dough, you
want to keep it cool to get flaky layers). 
5. Roll the dough out to about 1/2 in thickness, and cut out each biscuit. 
6. Place biscuits on lightly greased pan and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until
golden brown.

#### Gravy:
1. Brown sausage, and set aside. 
2. Whisk all ingredients with cold milk in a small sauce pan until completely smooth. 
3. Turn on heat to medium and bring to a simmer,then turn down heat and let simmer about 1 
minute and keep whisking while it simmers. 
4. Mix in sausage, turn off heat and set aside until ready to use. (It will thicken a little more while it sits). 
5. Pour gravy over biscuits and enjoy!
