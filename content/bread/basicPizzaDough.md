# Basic Pizza Dough

## Ingredients:

- 1⅓ cups warm water (105º to 115º F)
- 2¼ teaspoons active dry yeast
- 3½ to 4 cups unbleached all purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 2 teaspoons granulated sugar or honey
- cornmeal, for dusting

## Instructions:

1. Add water to a large bowl or the bowl of a standing electric mixer.
Scatter yeast over the water’s surface. Stir to combine. Let stand until
bubbly, about 5 minutes.
2. Add two cups of the flour, the olive oil, salt, and sweetener to the bowl
and mix with a wooden spoon or the mixer's paddle attachment until
well combined. Add remaining flour, about ½ cup at a time, mixing by
hand or with the paddle until the dough clears the sides of the bowl. If
working by hand, turn the dough out on a lightly floured surface and
knead, adding flour a little at a time if the dough still feels sticky.
Knead until dough is smooth and elastic. If using an electric mixer,
switch to the dough hook and knead on medium speed for about 5
minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. If the dough feels too
sticky, add a bit more of the flour and knead for another minute or
two. Transfer dough to a bowl coated with olive oil, turning the dough
once to coat it with oil. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rise in a
warm place until doubled in volume, about an hour.
3. Preheat oven to 475º F. Grease and dust two baking sheets with
cornmeal or place a baking stone in the oven (preheat for at least 45
minutes before baking). Gently deflate the dough and turn it out on a
lightly floured surface. Divide the dough in half (or into as many pieces
as you'd like pizzas) and shape each piece into a ball. Cover with
plastic wrap and let the dough rest for 10 to 15 minutes as you
prepare the toppings.
