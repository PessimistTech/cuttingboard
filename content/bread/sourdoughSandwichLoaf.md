# Sourdough Sandwich Loaf 
*Prep Time: 40mins | Cook Time: 40mins | Proofing Time: 2 hrs | Total Time: 3hrs 20mins
| Makes: 1 Loaf*

## Ingredients:

- 100 g Sourdough Discard (unfed sourdough starter)
- 250 g Water
- 500 g Bread Flour (or All Purpose Flour)
- 10 g Salt
- 20 g Sugar
- 60 g Butter (room temperature)
- 7 g Instant Yeast

## Instructions:

1. Combine the sourdough discard, water and flour into the bowl of your stand mixer and mix until
it forms a shaggy dough (around 30 seconds will do it). Leave the dough to rest for 30 minutes.
2. Add the salt, sugar, butter and yeast to the bowl and knead the dough until it is elastic, silky and
slapping the sides of the bowl (3-6min).
3. Let the dough rise until doubled (about an hour)
4. Once the dough has doubled, tip it out onto the counter, and gently stretch the dough out into a
rectangle. The short side of the rectangle should be farthest from you.
5. To shape the dough into a loaf, fold each side of the dough into the middle, then roll the dough
into a tight log with the seam underneath. Create tension in the dough by putting your hands at
the base and pulling the dough towards you, without lifting if off the countertop.
6. Once the dough is shaped, gently place it into the buttered loaf tin. Leave the dough to rise until
it's just above the rim of the tin (about an hour)
7. Preheat the oven to 350Â°
8. Once the dough has risen spray the top of your dough with some water mist and place into the
oven.
9. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes or until the loaf is golden brown.
10. Remove from the loaf tin and allow to cool on a wire rack.

This recipe is a "sourdough discard" recipe - so it's based on using unfed sourdough starter that
you accumulate when you're feeding a sourdough starter.
